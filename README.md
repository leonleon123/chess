# simple chess
Chess made with Node.js more specifically express and socket.io for back-end and Vue.js on front-end.

To install dependencies just run `npm install` and then `npm start` or `node server.js` to run.

To start a game think of a fun name with 4 letters and tell that to your friend, so he can join the same room. 
When two players are in the room each has to press ready and then the match begins.
You can also message the opponent by pressing the speech bubble on the right side.
